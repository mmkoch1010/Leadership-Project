<h1> Be The Change </h1>
    <h2>About the Campaign</h2>
<h3> Be the Change - American University is a campaign organized by AUSG to combat stigma and start conversation about mental illness amongst the AU student population. </h3>
    <h4><p>Mental illness is an invisible identity that many students at American University (AU) live with, yet there is a lack of conversation on campus about mental health. Mental health must be framed as a component of identity and wellness on the American University campus, as this is the only way to ensure that the largest population of students feels comfortable seeking treatment at the American University Counseling Center.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Today, college and university students are struggling with emotional and behavioral health problems at higher rates than previous generations. Between 2001 and 2008, the number of incoming students reporting mental health issues increased by 90% at four-year institutions. A recent study of college seniors found that 25.7% of students have sought counseling during their university tenure. At any given time, 32% of college and university students are dealing with a mental illness. Five percent of these students screen positive for panic disorders, six percent screen positive for anxiety disorders, nine percent screen positive for major depression, and 15% screen positive for self-injuring with thoughts of suicide. The rate of students living with mental illness increases when substance abuse and eating disorders, conditions common amongst student populations, are factored in to frequency rates of mental illness.</p>
<p>Despite an increased student population that experiences mental illness, every year at most only one-third of people living with mental illness seek treatment from a mental health professional. More than 80% of college students with mental illnesses who have not sought out help believe that treatment would be helpful and know that they might need help. Only 12% of students agree to the statement “I think less of someone who has received mental health treatment” suggesting that the stigma of therapy is no longer the main barrier to treatment in college campus environments. Instead, students report that they are unwilling to seek help because they are unsure of the severity of their problems as compared to the severity of the problems of their peers.</p>
<p>By promoting a culture of wellness on college campuses, students that may ordinarily be reluctant to use available services may be more willing to seek help, allowing students to get help before their mental health problems become severe. Community participation is a positive facilitator of recovery from mental illness. Civic engagement and friendship were each found to be predictive variables associated with recovery from mental illness and increased quality of life scores. Therefore, being a member of a group and engaging in a community that is centered on mental health as a component of wellness can aid in recovery from mental illness.</p></h4>
